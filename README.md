# MicroservicesBase

MicroservicesBase is a generic repository implementation for .NET Core applications, providing essential CRUD operations for entities within a database context. This repository template is designed to simplify the development of data access layers, making it ideal for microservices architectures.

## Features

- **Generic Repository:** Implement CRUD operations for entities with ease.
- **Integration with Entity Framework Core:** Seamlessly integrate with Entity Framework Core for database interactions.
- **Suitable for Microservices:** Designed to support microservices architectures.
- **Customizable:** Extend and customize the repository to fit your specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with MicroservicesBase, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/MrZainUlAbdeen/CoreMicroserviceBase.git`
2. **Explore the Code:** Take a look at the repository structure and the BaseRepository class.
3. **Customize as Needed:** Modify the repository to fit your project's requirements.
4. **Integrate with Your Application:** Use the repository in your .NET Core application to simplify data access.

## Usage

```csharp
// Example usage of the BaseRepository class
using System;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

// Define your DbContextWithTriggers class
public class YourDbContext : DbContextWithTriggers
{
    // Define your DbSet<TEntity> properties
    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}

// Create an instance of your DbContextWithTriggers
var dbContext = new YourDbContext();

// Create an instance of BaseRepository using your DbContextWithTriggers
var repository = new BaseRepository<Student, YourDbContext>(dbContext);

// Use the repository to perform CRUD operations
var newStudent = new Student { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe", DateOfBirth = DateTime.Now };
repository.Add(newStudent);
dbContext.SaveChanges();
